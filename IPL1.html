In the end, the franchises were all sold for a total of $723.59 million.The Indian Cricket League soon folded in 2008

<h3>Controversies</h3>
<p>

The IPL was hit by a huge match fixing scandal while the 2013 edition was going on when three players from the Rajasthan Royals were arrested by the police for match fixing and the team director of the Chennai Super Kings was accused of betting.
Subsequently these two teams were banned for two years before the 2016 edition of the tournament leading to the introduction of two new teams-Rising Pune Supergiants and the Gujarat Lions.

The players from the two banned teams were then accommodated in these two new teams.MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina who were previously a part of Chennai Super Kings then went on to captain Pune and Gujarat respectively.Also before the 2016 edition
Pepsi cancelled its contract as the title sponsor of the IPL and VIVO,which is a chinese multinational technology company became the new sponsor.
